# CheckIn_CS339
Project for cs339

----
## Todo List
- [x] Implement Basic Check in function.
- [x] Set a box to input student name.
- [x] Send global identity and student name.
- [x] UDP package encode.
  I think it is a good idea to just encode the id, since the id is too long, and we can
  apply some methods to encode it to maybe 6 chars including numbers and letters with time,
  so we can kill two birds with one stone.
- [ ] Build Teacher UI.
- [ ] Show current check in situations.
